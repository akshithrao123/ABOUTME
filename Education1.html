        <div><h1>MY BASE EDUCATION <h1></div>
        <div>
            <p>Lets start my education,when i was class 10th i studied in Fiitjee World School and this school mainly focused for jee aspirants and in this school i learnt many things 
                including studies and some sports.In intermediate I studied in Velocity Junior College and in this college the faculties were not good in teaching and right now you 
                were thinking? why i went from highly qualified school to a normal college.the answer is i realised that the knowledge will not develop form where we are studying and
                which institution we are studying.</p>
                </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Then in engineering i choose to Amrita University and here the most attractive feature is the nature and i luv this university and we can come up with some strict rules but 
            the college was to friendly to students and i come to know about our spiritual leader Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi from this univeristy and she is the inspiration to mankind.
