        <div><h1>THE THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ME <h1></div>
        <div><p>I like to travel throught the globe and at 10 th grade i got less points and my mood went on bad swing
            And my carrier started in second year,started to learn things and tried to implement things and i got little confused in intermediate level 
            Whether i should take MPC or BIPC and later after advice by my parents and i started to realize that if i take BIPC then i should study more 
           than my capability levels and i give up BIPC and when i was 10 th i would top biology subject with 10 points in our class and i think this made
            to take up this challenge.</p>
        <p> I love to play sports and sports are not only for fitness to your body but also some games are mean to challenge and i am a foodie and i luv to cook
            varieties of food and my mom is role model in every aspect of my life and i like to dance,but i didnt got a proper oppurnity in my life to prove my self
            that i can dance better.</p>

        <p>
            I believe only one thing in my life the marks never judge your skills and only knowledge will judge when you raise to high and by words by our beloved 
            leader A.P.J ABDUL KALAM and he says that when you turn back form your carrier your marks are of no use and the only thing matters is your memories.
